# How to run files?
```
Step 1: Go to src folder.
Step 2: run "python crete_folds.py"
Step 3: run "python train.py --fold <number: '0 to 4' folds> --model <model name as per ./src/model_dispatcher.py> 
        (You will get all folds output and your model is stored in models folder!) 
        or you can run ./src/run.sh file for 'all models' with '4' folds.
```
